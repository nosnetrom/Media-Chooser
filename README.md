Media-Chooser
=============

Some simple HTML5 and JavaScript/jQuery to serve up the correct audio/video format for the user's browser. Also dependent on Modernizr.

===
I wrote this script for http://nosnetrom.com/music/ and http://nosnetrom.com/portfolio/. I have no illusions that a user can pick the correct media format for his/her browser, so I thought I'd do it myself.
